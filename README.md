### Enhance User Experience in Air Alert App: Analysis and Prototyping
Thesis Reporsitory

This repository contains the materials and outputs developed for my Bachelor's Thesis (Ukrainian Catholic University, 2025).  
The project focuses on enhancing the usability and sustainability of air raid alert applications through user-centered design, cognitive load minimization, and prototype testing.

### Project Overview

Because extended war has placed additional psychological burdens on civilians, alert apps developed at th start of the war are losing their value due to alert fatigue and mental overload.
This research investigates existing air alert apps, identifies UX pain points, and recommends design strategies to improve user engagement and responsiveness.
